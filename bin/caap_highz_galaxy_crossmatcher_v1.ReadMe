a_dzliu_code_highz_galaxy_crossmatcher_v1.py

This code is used before 20170223. 

In this code, we use find max peak to help remove bright pixels and estimate the rms of each cutout image, so as to deterine the S/N of the aperture photometry of the source. 

In new version (v2), we use pixel histogram Gaussian fitting to do that, and is much faster. So this version (v1) is not used.
